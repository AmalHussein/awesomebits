Hi <%= @project.name %>!

We wanted to send you this (automated) email to let you know that we have
received your Awesome Foundation application. Your application will be
considered at the specified chapterâ€™s next deliberation meeting.
Unfortunately, we are not able to personally respond to all of our
applicants, but be sure to follow our Twitter account at
http://twitter.com/awesomefound and our blog at
http://awesomefoundation.org/blog/ for information about grants from all
of our chapters as well as future application deadlines.

Thanks for your interest in the Awesome Foundation!
