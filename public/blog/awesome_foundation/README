This is the wordpress theme for the Awesome Foundation blog.

The theme must link to the awesomefoundation.org stylesheet in the header-head.php file before it links to the theme's own style sheet.

The source for the logo in the header of the wordpress theme is also the awesomefoundation.org site.

Any changes made to the .php or .scss files stored here in the awesomefoundation.org rails site in the public/blog/awesome_foundation directory must be copied to the theme that is actually installed in the wordpress blog.
